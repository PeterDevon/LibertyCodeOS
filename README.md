**Choose Freedom. Choose LibertyCodeOS.**

LibertyCodeOS is a extremely private, customizable Linux distribution (minimal Debian based) aimed at users who care about privacy and also want to do cool stuff with media creation or software development, but really you can use it however you want.

**Why LibertyCodeOS, and not any other operating system or Linux distro?**
LibertyCodeOS stands out by putting the **user** in charge of what happens with their data. While other Linux distros are naturally good with user privacy and malware protection (because, its Linux after all :)), they don't go the extra mile when it comes to this stuff. LibertyCodeOS comes **built in with a VPN that is not backed by any company or corporation, just hard coded from scratch by the developers here**.
